# LLM Modeled After My Personal Data

This project aimed to create a personal AI that anyone can talk to, modeled after my own data. The AI uses a combination of natural language processing tools and deep learning models to generate personalized responses based on the user's query.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **GPT-4**: A deep learning language model that generates human-like text.
  
- **Llama_index**: A search engine for natural language queries.

- **Langchain**: A tool for processing and analyzing personal data.

- **OpenAI**: A tool for natural language processing and machine learning.

- **Google Colab**: A cloud-based platform for running Python code.

## Installation

Open the Google Colab project from the ipynb file and run the program. By block 4, Use an openapi key to succesfully run the program.

## Usage
Create a `data.txt` file with your personal data.

Run the app and interact with the personal AI by typing your query into the text input field and press enter to apply. The AI will then generate a personalized response based on your query and the personal data.
