# LLM Modeled After My Personal Data

This project aimed to create a personal AI that anyone can talk to, modeled after my own data. The AI uses a combination of natural language processing tools and deep learning models to generate personalized responses based on the user's query.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **GPT-4**: A deep learning language model that generates human-like text.
  
- **Llama_index**: A search engine for natural language queries.

- **Langchain**: A tool for processing and analyzing personal data.

- **OpenAI**: A tool for natural language processing and machine learning.

- **Google Colab**: A cloud-based platform for running Python code.
